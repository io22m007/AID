<a name="limitations"></a>
# Limitations
- The intention of this CSE implemention is to support education and learning, experiments, and demonstrations, but not a production environment. **Use it at your own risk.**
- The underlying communication stacks and database system are not optimized in any way for high-volume, high-availability, or high-reliability.
- Unsupported resource types are just stored, but no validations or functionality are provided for those resources.
