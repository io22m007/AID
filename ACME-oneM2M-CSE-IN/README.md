## Changes

Please see the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and this [discussion](https://github.com/ankraft/ACME-oneM2M-CSE/discussions/110) for the detailed list of changes.

### Highlights in this release

- Support for the \<action> and \<dependency> resource types
- Support for partial retrieve
- New text UI for the console interface
- Request recording to show the oneM2M communication flow, and to help with debugging  
- Starting support draft and experimental oneM2M Release 5 features

### Improvements
- Big overall speed improvements for database operations ( > 10-100+ times for big resource trees).
**Unfortunately this means an incompatible change in the DB schemas**
- Improved resource validation (complex and enumeration types)

### <font color="red">Breaking Changes</font>
- The script interpreter is changed to a lisp-based language in this release. Be aware that scripts in the old format need be converted manually.
- The DB schemas are updated due to the necessary changes for the speed improvements.
- Renamed some configuration settings and section titles (see [discussion](https://github.com/ankraft/ACME-oneM2M-CSE/discussions/110)).

### What to expect in the next release
