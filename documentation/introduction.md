# Introduction Intelligent Warehouse System

The Intelligent Warehouse System aims to be a scaleable solution for giving an overview of the stock in a warehouse. It supports especially small goods with high quantities (e.g. screws). The system uses scales to determine the weight of these small goods in boxes and provides useful information via a dashboard to users. It also consists of LEDs to indicate the stock of each good directly in the warehouse to get a quick overview or easily find wares which need to be restocked. 

## Basic Setup 
The system consists of several Raspberry Pi Zero which are linked together over a network. The Raspberry Pis are split into two roles:
- Central node: Consisting of one Raspberry Pi controling the Dashboard and the whole infrastructure. 
- Shelf Nodes: 

 using the One M2M standard.
